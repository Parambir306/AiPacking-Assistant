🧳 AI Packing Assistant — Smart Packing Made Easy!
AI Packing Assistant is a smart web app built using Streamlit (for GUI), Python (for logic), and OpenWeatherMap & Travel APIs (for real-time weather and destination context). It helps travelers generate personalized packing lists based on trip duration, destination, weather conditions, and activities — all through natural language input like:

"What should I pack for a 5-day trip to Manali in December for trekking?"

🛠️ Built With
The AI Packing Assistant is developed using Python as the primary programming language for implementing core logic and context-driven rule systems. The user interface is built using Streamlit, which allows for rapid development of an interactive and responsive web application. To personalize recommendations based on weather conditions, the app integrates the OpenWeatherMap API for real-time and forecasted weather data. It also utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) to interpret user queries in plain language, extracting key details like destination, duration, and trip type. At its core, a custom rule-based engine intelligently maps this input to generate relevant and practical packing checklists tailored to the traveler’s needs.

Understands natural questions like:
"Packing list for Goa in monsoon" or "What to take for a 3-day work trip to Bangalore?"

🌦️ Weather-Aware Packing
Fetches real-time weather to recommend clothing — warm clothes for cold places, rain gear for rainy forecasts, etc.

🎯 Activity-Based Suggestions
Suggests gear based on user activities — e.g., hiking gear for trekking, formal clothes for business trips, beachwear for coastal vacations.
